Types of Data Structures 
========================

Linear Data Structures
----------------------
Array 📊 – Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Fast access but resizing is costly.
Linked List 🔗 – A sequence of nodes, where each node points to the next. Good for dynamic memory usage.
Stack 🥞 – LIFO (Last In, First Out), like a stack of plates.
Queue 🚶‍♂️ – FIFO (First In, First Out), like a line at a store.
Deque (Double-ended Queue) 🔄 – Elements can be added or removed from both ends.

--------------------------------------------------------------
2️ Non-Linear Data Structures
------------------------
Tree 🌳 – A hierarchical structure (e.g., Binary Tree, BST, AVL, B-Trees, etc.).
Graph 🔗 – A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (can be directed or undirected).

--------------------------------------------------------------
3️ Hash-based Data Structures
-------------------------
Hash Table / Hash Map 🔑 – Uses a hashing function to store key-value pairs efficiently.
